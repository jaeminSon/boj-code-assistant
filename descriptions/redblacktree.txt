red-black tree

1. A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color (red or black) to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

2. The time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations in a red-black tree is \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree, ensuring the height of the tree is logarithmic relative to the number of nodes.
