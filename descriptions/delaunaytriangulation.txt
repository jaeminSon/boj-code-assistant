delaunay triangulation

(1) Delaunay triangulation is a geometric algorithm that generates a triangulation for a set of points such that no point is inside the circumcircle of any triangle.

(2) The complexity of Delaunay triangulation is generally \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points; this reflects the time required to sort and process all points in the plane.
