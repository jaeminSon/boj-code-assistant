tree decomposition

1. Tree decomposition is a method to map a graph into a tree structure in order to facilitate certain types of computational problems, particularly those involving graph width and subgraph connectivity.

2. The complexity of algorithms using tree decomposition generally depends on two parameters: the number of vertices \( n \) in the original graph, and the "width" \( w \) of the tree decomposition. For example, many problems that are NP-hard on general graphs can be solved in \( O(n \cdot f(w)) \) time when using tree decomposition, where \( f(w) \) is a function that depends exponentially on the width \( w \). Thus, the overall efficiency is highly influenced by \( w \), making tree width a crucial factor.
