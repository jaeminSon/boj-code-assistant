segment tree

### Description
A segment tree is a data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments, allowing for efficient querying and updating of range-based properties such as minimum, maximum, sum, and more.

### Complexity
- **Building the Tree:** \( O(n) \)
  - **n:** Number of elements in the array.
- **Querying:** \( O(\log n) \)
  - **\log n:** Logarithmic complexity relative to the number of elements, representing the height of the balanced segment tree.
- **Updating:** \( O(\log n) \)
  - **\log n:** Similar reason as querying; updates propagate through the height of the tree.
