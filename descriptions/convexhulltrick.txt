convex hull trick

(1) The "convex hull trick" is an optimization technique used to maintain a dynamic set of linear functions and efficiently query the minimum (or maximum) value at a given point.

(2) Complexity:
- Adding a new line: O(log n) on average for the dynamic variant using a balanced binary search tree, where \(n\) is the number of lines.
- Querying the minimum/maximum: O(log n) with a binary search mechanism on the same structure.

Here:
- \(O\): (Big O notation) denotes the upper bound complexity to provide an asymptotic limit on the algorithmâ€™s growth rate.
- \(n\): Represents the number of lines or functions in the set.
