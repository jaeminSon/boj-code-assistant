lowest common ancestor

1. The "lowest common ancestor" (LCA) algorithm finds the lowest node in a tree that has both given nodes as descendants.
2. The complexity can be O(n) for a naive approach or O(log n) for advanced techniques like binary lifting or using range minimum queries, where "n" represents the number of nodes in the tree.
