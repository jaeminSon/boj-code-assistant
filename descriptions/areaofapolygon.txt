area of a polygon

1. (Brief Description) The "area of a polygon" algorithm calculates the area of a simple polygon using the coordinates of its vertices.

2. (Complexity) The time complexity of the algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of vertices of the polygon. This denotes that the computational time grows linearly with the number of vertices.
