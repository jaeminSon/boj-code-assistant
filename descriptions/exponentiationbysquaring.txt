exponentiation by squaring

1. Exponentiation by squaring is an efficient algorithm to compute powers of a number by recursively reducing the exponent by squaring the base when the exponent is even and multiplying the base with the result when the exponent is odd.

2. The time complexity of exponentiation by squaring is O(log n), where n is the exponent. This means that the number of operations required grows logarithmically with respect to the size of the exponent.
