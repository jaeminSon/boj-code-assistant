boyerâ€“moore majority vote

1. The Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm identifies a candidate element that appears more than half the time in a sequence of elements if such an element exists.

2. The complexity is O(n), where "n" represents the number of elements in the sequence. This denotes that the algorithm processes each element a constant number of times, making its time complexity linear.
