chordal graph

1. A chordal graph is a graph where every cycle of four or more vertices has a chord, which is an edge that connects two non-adjacent vertices in the cycle.
2. The recognition of a chordal graph can be achieved in O(n + m) time complexity, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph.
