dynamic programming using connection profile

1. Dynamic programming using connection profile is a technique that breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves them using memoization, specifically taking into account the connectivity or relationship between state transitions, often used in optimization problems on graphs or networks.

2. The complexity can vary greatly depending on the specific problem and how the connection profiles are defined. Generally, the time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of states (or nodes) and m is the average number of transitions (or edges) per state in the problem, and the space complexity can be O(n*k), where k is the number of stored profiles or states.
