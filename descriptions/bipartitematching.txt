bipartite matching

1. **Description**: Bipartite matching is an algorithm used to find the maximum matching in a bipartite graph, where a matching is a set of edges without common vertices and a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.

2. **Complexity**: The most common bipartite matching algorithm, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, has a time complexity of \( O(E \sqrt{V}) \), where \( V \) is the number of vertices and \( E \) is the number of edges in the bipartite graph.

   - \( V \): The number of vertices in the graph.
   - \( E \): The number of edges in the graph.
   - \( \sqrt{V} \): The square root of the number of vertices.

This complexity reflects the efficiency of the algorithm in finding an optimal solution, balancing the need to explore potential matchings and the efficiency in traversing the graph structure.
