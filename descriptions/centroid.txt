centroid

1. The centroid algorithm is used to decompose a tree into smaller, more manageable pieces by recursively finding the centroid (node with roughly equal size subtrees) and removing it.

2. The complexity of centroid decomposition is O(N log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This accounts for examining each node and handling the logarithmic layers of recursive decomposition.
