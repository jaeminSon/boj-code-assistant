point in convex polygon check

1. The "point in convex polygon check" algorithm determines whether a given point lies inside, outside, or on the boundary of a convex polygon.

2. Complexity: \(O(\log n)\)

- \(O\) (Big O) notation describes the upper bound on the time complexity.
- \(n\) represents the number of vertices in the convex polygon.

This logarithmic complexity typically assumes using a binary search or other efficient methods leveraging the convexity property of the polygon to expedite the point location process.
