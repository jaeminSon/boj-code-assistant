dynamic programming on trees

1. Dynamic programming on trees is an optimization technique that involves breaking down problems on tree structures into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once to save computational effort.

2. The complexity is generally O(V), where V represents the number of vertices (or nodes) in the tree, as each node and edge is typically processed a constant number of times.
