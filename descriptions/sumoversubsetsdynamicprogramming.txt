sum over subsets dynamic programming

1. The sum over subsets dynamic programming algorithm calculates the sum of a function applied to all subsets of a given set, efficiently computing this for all possible subsets.

2. Complexity: \( O(n \cdot 2^n) \)
   - \( n \) is the size of the set.
   - \( 2^n \) represents the number of all possible subsets of the given set.
