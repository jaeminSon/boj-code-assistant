square root decomposition

1. Square root decomposition is a technique used to answer range queries and perform updates efficiently by dividing the input data into blocks of size approximately the square root of the total number of elements.

2. The complexity is \(O(\sqrt{n})\) per query or update, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
