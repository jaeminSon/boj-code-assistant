dynamic programming using bitfield

1. Dynamic programming using bitfields involves encoding states or subsets as binary numbers (bitfields) to efficiently represent and transition between states in optimization problems.
   
2. Complexity: Often O(n * 2^n) where n is the number of elements being considered; here, 2^n represents the number of possible subsets or states and n accounts for the transitions or updates for each state.
