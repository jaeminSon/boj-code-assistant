suffix array and lcp array

1. **Brief Description:** Suffix arrays are sorted arrays of all suffixes of a given string, and the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array provides the lengths of the longest common prefixes between consecutive suffixes in that suffix array.

2. **Complexity:**
   - **Suffix Array Construction:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
   - **LCP Array Construction:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. 

**Explanation of Symbols:**
- \(O(\cdot)\): Big O notation describing the upper bound on the running time as a function of input size.
- \(n\): The number of characters in the input string.
