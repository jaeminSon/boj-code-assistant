articulation points and bridges

1. Articulation points and bridges are crucial components in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components, potentially disconnecting the graph.

2. The complexity of finding articulation points and bridges using Depth-First Search (DFS) is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
