graph traversal

**Brief Description**: Graph traversal is the process of visiting all the vertices (and possibly edges) of a graph in a systematic manner.

**Complexity**:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: \( O(V + E) \)
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: \( O(V + E) \)

Where:
- \( V \) is the number of vertices in the graph
- \( E \) is the number of edges in the graph

This means the complexity depends on the total number of vertices and edges, indicating linear growth relative to both.
