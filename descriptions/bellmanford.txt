bellmanâ€“ford

1. The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, and can handle graphs with negative edge weights.

2. Complexity: \(O(V \cdot E)\)

- \(V\) represents the number of vertices in the graph.
- \(E\) represents the number of edges in the graph.

The algorithm's time complexity reflects that in the worst-case scenario, it relaxes each edge \(E\) up to \(V-1\) times.
