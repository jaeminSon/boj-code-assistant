discrete k-th root

1. The discrete k-th root algorithm finds an integer \( x \) such that \( x^k ≡ a \ (\text{mod} \ n) \), where \( k \), \( a \), and \( n \) are given integers.

2. Complexity: \( O(\sqrt{k \cdot n}) \)

- \( k \): the exponent in the equation \( x^k \).
- \( n \): the modulus in the equation \( x^k ≡ a \ (\text{mod} \ n) \).

This computational complexity arises because the algorithm typically involves iterating through potential solutions and verifying them, often using methods such as the baby-step giant-step algorithm for efficiency.
