inclusion and exclusion

(1) The inclusion-exclusion principle is a combinatorial method used to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of various intersections of these sets.

(2) The complexity of applying the inclusion-exclusion principle depends on the number of sets \( n \) and it's \( O(2^n) \), where \( n \) is the number of sets being considered, because it involves calculating the sizes of all possible intersections of these sets, which are \( 2^n \) in total.
