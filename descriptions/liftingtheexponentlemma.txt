lifting the exponent lemma

1. The "lifting the exponent lemma" is used to find the largest power of a prime \( p \) that divides a binomial coefficient or a factorial.

2. The complexity of applying the lemma itself is typically \( O(\log_p(n)) \), where:
    - \( n \) is the integer whose prime factor's largest exponent is being sought,
    - \( p \) is the prime number in question.
This complexity comes from repeatedly dividing \( n \) by \( p \).
