dijkstra's

1. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

2. Complexity: \( O((V + E) \log V) \)
   - \( V \) is the number of vertices in the graph.
   - \( E \) is the number of edges in the graph.
   - The \(\log V\) factor arises from priority queue operations used in the algorithm.
