dominator tree

1. A dominator tree of a directed graph is a tree where each node's parent is the immediate dominator, meaning the first node encountered that must be traversed before reaching the current node from a designated start node.
   
2. The complexity of constructing a dominator tree is O(V+E), where V represents the number of vertices (nodes) and E represents the number of edges in the graph.
