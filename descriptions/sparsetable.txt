sparse table

1. A sparse table is a data structure that allows querying of the minimum (or other associative operations) over a static array in constant time after O(n log n) preprocessing time.

2. Complexity:
   - Preprocessing: O(n log n)
     - n: the number of elements in the array.
     - log n: logarithmic factor due to precomputation for ranges of lengths that are powers of 2.
   - Query: O(1)
     - Queries are handled in constant time using precomputed values in the table.
