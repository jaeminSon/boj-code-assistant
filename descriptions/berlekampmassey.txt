berlekampâ€“massey

1. The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm is used to find the shortest linear feedback shift register (LFSR) that generates a given binary sequence.

2. Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the given sequence. The algorithm analyzes subsequences of the given sequence to iteratively construct and adjust the polynomial representing the LFSR.
