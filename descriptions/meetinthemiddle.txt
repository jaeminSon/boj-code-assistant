meet in the middle

1. "Meet in the middle" is an algorithmic technique to solve problems by dividing the problem into two smaller subproblems, solving each, and then combining their solutions.

2. The complexity is generally O(2^(n/2)), where n is the size of the problem, because it involves splitting the problem into two halves, each of size n/2, and evaluating all possible solutions in each half.
