bipartite graph

Sure! 

1. A bipartite graph algorithm determines whether a graph is bipartite, meaning its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
 
2. The time complexity of checking if a graph is bipartite using BFS or DFS is \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
