euler tour technique

1. The Euler Tour Technique is a depth-first traversal method used to preprocess trees for efficient querying of properties and relationships between nodes.

2. **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for preprocessing the tree, where \(N\) is the number of nodes since each node is visited once during the traversal.    
   **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing the Euler tour and auxiliary structures.    
   
   In these notations:
   - \(N\) represents the number of nodes in the tree. 
   - The \(O(N)\) notation means the algorithm's running time and space usage increase linearly with the number of nodes.
